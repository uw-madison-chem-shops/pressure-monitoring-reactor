#+TITLE: pressurized reactor - Chase Salazar
* DONE basic planning
planning control box
microcomputer:
- rasperry pi model B+
- NCD i2c adapter
pressure transducer
- OMEGA MMA150C1P4C5T4A5CE (4-20 mA, 0-150 PSI)
- NCD PR33-28 (12 channel, 16 bit, 2 samples per second, i2c)
temperature transducer
- NCD PR35-12 (1 channel, K-Type Thermocouple Adapter (accuracy +- 2.2 deg C)
heating elements
- ???????
power supply
- 5V: PI
- 12V: NCD board, OMEGA transducers
* DONE heating circuit planning
HEATING CIRCUIT
- 2x 1000 W heaters: 2000 W = 16.7 A
* DONE add 5 V power supply
* DONE pressure transduce
* TODO (Steve) purchase electrical enclosure boxes
* TODO (?) (machine shop) engrave "CAUTION: SURFACE HOT" on sides of aluminum block
* TODO (machine shop) insert thermal fuses
* TODO (machine shop) set screws for heating cartridges
* TODO (machine shop) channel along bottom of block for wires
