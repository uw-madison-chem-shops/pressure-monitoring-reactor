# A Gas Uptake/Evolution Reactor for Monitoring Gas-Liquid Chemical Transformations in Parallel

This repository contains supplemental material for the paper "A Gas Uptake/Evolution Reactor for Monitoring Gas-Liquid Chemical Transformations in Parallel".
Please read the manuscript for more context about these materials.

## Reactor Cell

The reactor cell is made up of three pieces:

1. body
2. arms
3. clamp ring

CAD drawings for each of these pieces can be found in the `reactor-cell` folder.
These drawings were created using SolidWorks CAD software, and a copy of SolidWorks will be required to open or manipulate them.
For convinience, machinist drawings as PDFs are also shared.

Refer to the Supplementary Material PDF associated with the main publication for assembly instructions.

## Heating Block

The heating block is made up of six pieces:

1. main block
2. sidebars
3. cooling tube
4. side insulation
5. top insulation
6. end insulation

CAD drawings for each of these pieces can be found in the `heating block` folder.
These drawings were created using SolidWorks CAD software, and a copy of SolidWorks will be required to open or manipulate them.
For convinience, machinist drawings as PDFs are also shared.

Refer to the Supplementary Material PDF associated with the main publication for assembly instructions.

## Manifold

A CAD drawing of the gas distribution manifold can be found in the `manifold` folder.
This drawing was created using AutoCAD software, and software capable of reading `.dwg` files is required to open or manipulate it.
For convinience, a machinist drawing as PDF is also shared.

Refer to the Supplementary Material PDF associated with the main publication for assembly instructions.

## Electronics

CAD drawings describing the panel cutouts for the electronics box can be found in the `electronics` folder.

## Software

Custom software developed for this reactor can be found in the `software` folder.
This is separated out into the director and interface, as described in the Supplementary Material PDF.
Further instructions for installing this software onto the Raspberry Pi can be found in the `software` folder.
