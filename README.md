# A Gas Uptake/Evolution Reactor for Monitoring Gas-Liquid Chemical Transformations in Parallel

This repository contains supplemental material for the paper "A Gas Uptake/Evolution Reactor for Monitoring Gas-Liquid Chemical Transformations in Parallel".
Please read the manuscript for more context about these materials.

## Reactor Cell

The reactor cell is made up of three pieces:

1. body
2. arms
3. clamp ring

CAD drawings for each of these pieces can be found in the `reactor-cell` folder.
These drawings were created using SolidWorks CAD software, and a copy of SolidWorks will be required to open or manipulate them.
For convinience, machinist drawings as PDFs are also shared.

Refer to the Supplementary Material PDF associated with the main publication for assembly instructions.

## Heating Block

The heating block is made up of six pieces:

1. main block
2. sidebars
3. cooling tube
4. side insulation
5. top insulation
6. end insulation

CAD drawings for each of these pieces can be found in the `heating block` folder.
These drawings were created using SolidWorks CAD software, and a copy of SolidWorks will be required to open or manipulate them.
For convinience, machinist drawings as PDFs are also shared.

Refer to the Supplementary Material PDF associated with the main publication for assembly instructions.
