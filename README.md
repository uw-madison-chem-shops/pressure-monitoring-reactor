# A Gas Uptake/Evolution Reactor for Monitoring Gas-Liquid Chemical Transformations in Parallel

This repository contains supplemental material for the paper "A Gas Uptake/Evolution Reactor for Monitoring Gas-Liquid Chemical Transformations in Parallel".
Please read the manuscript for more context about these materials.

## Reactor Cell

The reactor cell is made up of three pieces:

1. Body
2. Arms
3. Clamp Ring

CAD drawings for each of these pieces can be found in the `reactor-cell` folder.
These drawings were created using SolidWorks CAD software, and a copy of SolidWorks will be required to open or manipulate them.
For convinience, machinist drawings as PDFs are also shared.
